# HW-1-Create-Digital-Controller
First Homework where students must create a game controller using digital inputs.

### Getting Started
- Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed
- Clone this repo, or download the zip file.
- Navigate to the folder for this project in a terminal.
- At the top level of the project folder in your terminal run the command `npm install`

### Running the Game
- At the top level of the project folder in your terminal run the command `npm start`
- A window for the game should automatically open with a debug/console next ot it.

## Assignment: Make a Controller Using Digital Inputs

Using any digital inputs and the digital read function in Arduino, make a controller that is able to execute all of the game actions: Walk Left, Walk Right, Jump. Upload your Arduino code and a short video of your controller in action to canvas when complete.

## Serial API
The commands for the game are listed below. Each command must be followed by a '-' so that the game software can distinguish them.

- Walk Left : `l`
- Walk Right : `r`
- Jump : `j`

## Debugging Tips
- Remember to exit the game before uploading code to the Arduino

## Sources
- This demo is based on the basic Phaser [tutorial](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part8)
